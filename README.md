CHANGING THE UI
---------------
Firstly, if you would like to make any changes to the main menu specifically, the best way to implement it is to either
modify the **MainActivity.java** file if you want to add any buttons or extra UI items. If you would like to have another
view option for example a help screen, make a new activity and modify the **MainActivity.java** so when a button is
pressed, it will start the new activity and delete the previous.

Secondly, if you would like to modify the type of questions, in **game.java**, you can find the **newQuestion** method and
modify anything in there to adjust the question type to your liking. Now if you would like to, you can also add a
**Scoreboard** by making a new activity so when the timer is up is starts the **Scoreboard** activity. All the information
relating to the timer can be seen in the **countDownTimer** method on line 315.

Whenever you want to add new buttons or textViews, be sure to add them using the .xml file corresponding to the
correct java file it's linked to.


LOCATIONS
---------
To find the necessary files to update, go to app -> src -> main -> java/com/example/quizlet and there you will see
the 2 java files. Then, when you want to check the xml files go to app -> src -> main -> res and all the files
will be there.
